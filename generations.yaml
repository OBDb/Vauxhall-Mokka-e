    description: "The Vauxhall Mokka-e (branded as Opel Mokka-e in continental Europe) represents the fully electric variant of the second-generation Mokka subcompact crossover, the first developed under PSA Group (now Stellantis) ownership after the acquisition of Vauxhall/Opel from General Motors. Built on the Stellantis CMP (Common Modular Platform) architecture designed to accommodate multiple powertrain types, the Mokka-e features distinctive styling with Vauxhall's new 'Vizor' front end design—a blacked-out panel spanning the width of the vehicle integrating headlights and brand logo—and a more angular, assertive appearance compared to its predecessor. Dimensionally smaller than the first-generation Mokka but with improved interior packaging, the Mokka-e emphasizes style and technology over maximum utility. Powered by a 136 horsepower (100 kW) electric motor driving the front wheels and drawing energy from a 50 kWh battery pack, the Mokka-e delivers a WLTP-rated range of approximately 209 miles (338 km) on a full charge. DC fast charging at up to 100 kW allows for an 80% charge in about 30 minutes. The interior features Vauxhall's Pure Panel digital cockpit combining dual widescreens (up to 12 inches combined) for instruments and infotainment, creating a minimalist, high-tech environment with physical controls limited to essential functions. Standard equipment is generous across all trim levels, including LED headlights, a 7-inch touchscreen, cruise control, and multiple driver assistance systems, with higher trims adding features like adaptive cruise control, heated seats, and a larger 10-inch touchscreen. As one of the first fully electric models launched under Vauxhall's commitment to electrify its entire lineup, the Mokka-e plays a key role in the brand's transition toward zero-emission vehicles while offering the higher seating position and crossover styling increasingly preferred by European consumers, though with a more fashion-conscious approach than many of its more practically oriented competitors."
